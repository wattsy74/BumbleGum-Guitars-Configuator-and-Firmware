## Configuration API

### Read Configuration
```
READFILE:config.json
```
**Response**: JSON configuration data

### Write Configuration

## Tilt Wave Effect API

### Enable/Disable Tilt Wave
```
TILTWAVE_ENABLE:1    # Enable
TILTWAVE_ENABLE:0    # Disable
```

### Trigger Tilt Wave Manually
```
TILTWAVE
```

### Tilt Wave Configuration
The tilt wave effect can be configured through the main configuration:
- `tilt_wave_enabled`: Boolean to enable/disable the effect
- Effect automatically triggers when tilt sensor is activated
- Duration: 2.4 seconds (120 steps at 50Hz)
- Animation: 3 complete sweeps with cascading blue-to-white effect

### Tilt Wave Color Palette
19-color gradient used for the wave effect:
```python
WAVE_COLORS = [
    (0, 0, 255),      # Deep blue
    (0, 100, 255),    # Bright blue
    (0, 150, 255),    # Electric blue  
    (50, 200, 255),   # Cyan-blue
    (100, 220, 255),  # Light electric blue
    (150, 240, 255),  # Bright cyan
    (200, 250, 255),  # Nearly white-blue
    (255, 255, 255),  # Pure white (peak)
    # ... fade back sequence
]
```

## JavaScript Interface

### Device Connection
```javascript
// Auto-detect and connect to BGG controller
const device = await window.electronAPI.getConnectedDevice();

// Write command to device
connectedPort.write("COMMAND\n");

// Listen for responses
connectedPort.on('data', (data) => {
  // Handle response
});
```

### Configuration Management
```javascript
// Read current config
connectedPort.write("READFILE:config.json\n");

// Write new config
const config = { /* config object */ };
connectedPort.write("WRITEFILE:config.json\n");
connectedPort.write(JSON.stringify(config) + "\n");
connectedPort.write("END\n");
```

### Event Handlers
```javascript
// Toggle tilt wave effect
document.getElementById('toggle-tilt-wave-btn')?.addEventListener('click', () => {
  closeConfigMenu();
  if (!connectedPort || !originalConfig) {
    updateStatus("Device not connected or config missing", false);
    return;
  }

  const current = originalConfig.tilt_wave_enabled || false;
  const next = !current;
  originalConfig.tilt_wave_enabled = next;

  connectedPort.write("WRITEFILE:config.json\n");
  connectedPort.write(JSON.stringify(originalConfig) + "\n");
  connectedPort.write("END\n");
  
  setTimeout(() => {
    connectedPort.write(`TILTWAVE_ENABLE:${next ? '1' : '0'}\n`);
  }, 200);
});
```
